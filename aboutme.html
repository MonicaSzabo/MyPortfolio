		<strong>Stage 1</strong>
		<br><br>
		As a kid growing up in Austin, TX in the 90s, I was definitely a child of technology. I listened to my Discman, rocked out with my HitClips, and owned Red, Blue, AND Yellow Pokémon on my Game Boy Color. I had not one, but three GeoCities pages - one all about me, one for my various boy obsessions, and one for my undying love for the Animorphs book series.  I Napstered, WinMXed, and BitTorrented all the best music (Savage Garden, oh yeah) and episodes of Buffy I could get my hands on.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Stage 2</strong>
		<br><br>
		In high school, I dreamed of writing code in my own cubicle.  Somehow though, that dream got pushed aside by the glitz and glamour of show business.  At the University of Texas in Austin, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Radio-Television-Film and moved to Los Angeles to be a documentary film editor.  In under 6 months, I realized the film biz was not for me, and moved back to Austin.
		<br><br>
		While at UT, I had a serendipitous encounter with a class about Deaf culture. I was instantly enthralled and continued my education at Austin Community College, training and eventually becoming an Educational Interpreter.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Stage 3</strong>
		<br><br>
		Feeling stuck at Stage 2, I began searching for job growth opportunities and creative outlets in which I could express myself. I stumbled upon my alma mater’s hosting of a new Coding Boot Camp in Austin!  I jumped on board and started picking up HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and more! My passion for code was reinvigorated and now my dream to code (whether in or out of a cubicle) has been reborn with a new fire.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Stage 4</strong>
		<br><br>
		Before graduating from my boot camp, I was awarded the coveted title of Web Developer for DigitalMarketer, an awesome Austin based company aiming to double the size of 10,000 small businesses by 2020! I now get to do what I love every day and I couldn’t be happier.
		<br><br>
		Next up, learning Unity and C# to make video games! Stay tuned!
