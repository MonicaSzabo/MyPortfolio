				<br><br>
				My first memory consists of maple syrup, my mother’s lap, and a sticky six-hour one-way trip to Austin, TX.  After completely missing my pancakes and dousing my poor mother, she told me, <q>Look out the window!  You’ll see our new house!</q>  Three-year-old me looked out the window in wonder.
				<br><br>
				Needless to say, I’ve changed nearly as much as my city in the last 25 years.  UT Austin was my inevitable college of choice and I obtained my BS in Radio, Television, and Film with Honors.  I dreamed of being a documentary film editor.  For my last semester, I moved to Los Angeles, participating in the UTLA program.  I worked on the shows <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> and <em>Party Down</em>.  While the weather suited me, the cost of living did not, and I returned to Austin without much of a life plan.
				<br><br>
				I had taken a course at UT called <em>The Perspectives of Deafness</em>. In all honesty, it was on Pick-A-Prof as an easy A.  Unplanned and unprepared, as love so often is, I instantly fell into it.  I had never met a Deaf individual but I found their culture eye opening and ground breaking.  Deaf people are not handicapped; they are enriched by their shared language and their shared experiences.  While twiddling my thumbs working at Barnes &#38; Noble, I decided to take classes at ACC to learn American Sign Language.  Before I knew it, I had graduated their program in Interpreting Services.  I began working in the education system as an Educational Interpreter.
				<br><br>
				While I love interpreting and find it to be a very rewarding job, there are few job growth opportunities nor are there many creative outlets.  I want to find a career where I can be recognized, be creative, and be myself.  Thus I signed up for the UT Coding Bootcamp where I am currently becoming a Full Stack Developer.  My tech knowledge continues to grow; I'll finish in October!
